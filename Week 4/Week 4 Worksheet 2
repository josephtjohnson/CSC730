Problem 1
Consider the following function and answer questions.
void f1(int n)
{
  if (n>0)
    {
      f1(n-1);
      for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
        System.out.print("*");
      System.out.println();
    }
}

1. Describe what the function does.
This function will print a left-aligned triangle made of asterisks. The function will begin by print 1 asterisk and will increase the number of asterisks printed until n rows have been printed. The last row
will contain n number of asterisks and each row before it will be n-1. It will call itself recursively until the base case is reached.

2. What will be the result of the function call f1(4)?

Problem 2
Consider the following functions and answer questions.
void f2(int n)
{
  f2(n, 0);
}
void f2(int n, int s)
{
  if (n>0)
  {
    f2(n-1, s+1);
    for (int i=0; i<s; i++)
      System.out.print(" ");
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
      System.out.print("*");
    System.out.println();
  }
}

1. Describe what the functions do.
The first function is a helper function to simplify the calling of the recursive function. The second function is our recursive function and it will print n number of right-aligned rows of asterisks.
The final row will have n number of asterisks and s number of spaces. each row before it will have n-1 number of asterisks with s+1 number of spaces. It will call itself recursively until the base 
case is reached.

2. What will be the result of the function call f2(4)?

Problem 3
In example program Example10Recursion, write a recursive function 
printNumbers(int n)
to print 2n lines, each of which contains a number as follows:
• The first n lines print numbers from n down to 1, with each line indented two more 
spaces than the previous line.
• The last n lines print numbers from 1 up to n, with each line indented two fewer 
spaces than the previous line.
For example, a function call printNumbers(4)should print
4
    3
        2
            1
            1
        2
    3
4
