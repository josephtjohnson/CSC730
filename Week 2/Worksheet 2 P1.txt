Consider a queue implemented by an array of size 5, with variables front and rear
keeping track of the indices of front and rear items of the queue. A sequence of operations is
performed on the queue:
enqueue ‘a’
enqueue ‘b’
enqueue ‘c’
enqueue ‘d’
dequeue
dequeue
enqueue ‘e’
enqueue ‘f’
dequeue
enqueue ‘g’
dequeue
dequeue
dequeue
enqueue ‘h’

After the above sequence of operations is completed, 
a) What are the items that have been dequeued? List them in the order they are dequeued.
b) What are the values of variables front and rear?
c) What is the content of the queue?

a: 
a->b->c->d->e->f

b:
front = 1, rear = 2

c:
[-, g, h, -, -]
