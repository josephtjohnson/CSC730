Consider a priority queue implemented by an array of size 5, with variable front keeping
track of the index of front item. Assume the smallest key is stored at the front of the priority 
queue. A sequence of operations is performed on the priority queue:
enqueue ‘c’
enqueue ‘f’
enqueue ‘a’
enqueue ‘b’
dequeue
dequeue
enqueue ‘h’
enqueue ‘d’
dequeue
enqueue ‘g’
dequeue
dequeue
dequeue
enqueue ‘e’
After the above sequence of operations is completed, what will be the
a) What are the items that have been dequeued? List them in the order they are dequeued.
a,b,c,d,f,g
b) What are the values of variables front?
c,c,a,a,b,c,c,c,d,d,f,g,h,e
c) What is the content of the priority queue?
[h,e, , , ]
